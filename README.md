# Talentpair Elm

Example integration for an Angular 1.5 / Elm app using es6, webpack and angular-elm-components

# Goals
1. Provide a minimal app that shows how to use all the elm hooks with Angular
2. Install and run with only npm install and npm start
3. Be able to update all elm files and have webpack reload
4. Do not want to manually maintain elm-package.json


# Using PyCharm
- There's a nice elm language plugin
- You cannot mark elm-stuff as excluded
