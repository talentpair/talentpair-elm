# Talentpair Elm

Example integration for an Angular 1.5 / Elm app using es6, webpack and angular-elm-components

# Goals
1. Provide a minimal app that shows how to use all the standard elm hooks with Angular
2. Install and run with only npm install and npm start
3. Be able to update any elm file and have webpack recompile and reload
4. Not have to manually maintain elm-package.json


# Using PyCharm
- There's a nice elm language plugin
- You cannot mark elm-stuff as excluded
